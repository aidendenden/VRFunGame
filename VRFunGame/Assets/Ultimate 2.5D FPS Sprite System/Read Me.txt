1. This asset contains assets from the open source project freedoom, which is public domain

2. There are a variety of ways to do this, I encourage you to find your own, but I animated them
through animation events, which set the sprite index of the script. I'm sure there are much more efficent ways, but 
this seemed like the easiest to do for now.

3. If you are applying this on a new sprite renderer, it won't work until you go 
into debug mode, the three dots at the top of the inspector, and enable it. From there, on the sprite renderer component, 
enable "cast shadows" and "recieve shadows."  

4. Make sure any sprites you import go into the resources folder. If you want to organize your sprites
by folder, create folders for them in the resources folder, and make sure you include the folder in the sprite name variable.

5. Make sure that any object with the sprite system component has a parent that dictates it's motion and or orientation. 
Otherwise, the script will not work!! If you want to add movement to a gameobject, do it through the parent, not the sprite
itself. The sprite will always be facing the camera.
